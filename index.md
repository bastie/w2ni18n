# Word to Number i18n

**Word to Number i18n** is a full new implementation of great Python word2number module for English sentences. In result of this work it

- support non-english languages
- provide the business logic as
    - Java Archiv
    - Python Module
    - .net DLL
- exclude some bugs from word2number
- *include some own bugs in result of it is a program not god*

The implementation want to be that
- more readable than using high-end programming language features
- more simplify than build high speed (compiler) result but also 
- more a usable than an extended ``Hello World``

**Word to Number i18n** convert number words from different languages with different programming languages eg. three hundred and forty two to numbers (342) or vingt-et-un (21) or две целых три десятых (2.3). 

## Download

- Python:   pip3
- Java:     GitHub repository
- CSharp:	nuget

## Programming language features

This is a part-feature-list of some features you would be see in result of compare the similar languages implementations. It does not mean these features are bad or good.

### Python
- Dynamic arrays inside language can use this instead of an Collection framework.
- Optional parameters
- Wrap OO-Class with procedural call in same source
- ...

### Java
- To convert a ``String`` to ``double`` localization information is ignored (``Locale``) and the **dot** is needed.
<br>``double doubleValue = Double.valueOf(decimalValueWithPoint);``
- Optional parameters
- ...

### CSharp
- Unlike Java it is important at converting a ``string`` to ``double`` the right localization information in the background exists (``CultureInfo``).
<br>``double doubleValue; double.TryParse (pointDelimitedDecimalValue, NumberStyles.Any,CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out doubleValue);``
    - but I need to declare variable ``doubleValue`` before(?).
- Semantic sugar is to get KEY and VALUE from dictionary at same time.
<br>``foreach (KeyValuePair<keyType, valueType> pair in this.filebasedNumberSystem){}``
- Working with Dictionary like Array with non-numeric index.
<br>``object value = this.dictionaryInstance[key];``
- Optional parameters
- ...


### Vala
- Nice using of ``??`` operator to ``null`` check like ``string withValue = nullableString ?? "value";``
- It is not posible with Gee 0.8 to give an other Collection in constructor and so ``add_all (an_other_collection);`` is a little bit more to coding...
- It isn't important where you ``main`` program method is - maybe in class, perhaps outside.

## Test system

Local test system is

- CPython 3.9 @ Darwin
- Java AdoptOpenJDK 15 @ Darwin
- CSharp net5.0 @ Darwin

Test can be better and add for error a new test case.
